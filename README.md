OOcharts is an awesome little project that makes it easy to embed and share Google Analytics data through charts. It was started in the Summer of 2012 by [Tin Bin](http://tinb.in) and continues to grow. There are a few basics you need to know in order to get started:

##API Keys##
API Keys are created to give access to certain Google Analytics profiles. For every request to OOcharts, you will need a valid API Key. These keys can be created in [Mission Control](https://app.oocharts.com/key/list).

##Queries##
Queries are packaged requests that are prebuild on [Mission Control](https://app.oocharts.com/query/list). Altough the API supports dynamic requests, Queries are useful for security.
